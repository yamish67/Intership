# VPN Encryption & Privacy Research

• VPNs use protocols such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, or WireGuard to encrypt traffic.
 
• Encryption strength can go up to AES-256, protecting data from sniffing and interception.
 
• No-log policies ensure user activity isn’t stored.
 
• VPNs help bypass geo-blocks, prevent ISP tracking, and provide Wi-Fi security in public networks.

# Benefits of VPNs

✅ Encrypts traffic to prevent eavesdropping

✅ Access restricted or geo-blocked content

✅ Adds security on public Wi-Fi

# Limitations of VPNs

❌ Can reduce browsing speed

❌ Free versions may have limited server access or bandwidth

❌ Doesn’t protect from malware or phishing attacks by itself

❌ Some websites block VPN IPs
