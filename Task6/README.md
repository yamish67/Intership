# Best practices for creating strong passwords

-Use a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to increase complexity

-Make passwords at least 12 characters long to resist brute-force attacks

-Avoid using common words, phrases, or predictable patterns such as "123456" or "Password!"
