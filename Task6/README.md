# Best practices for creating strong passwords

-Use a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to increase complexity

-Make passwords at least 12 characters long to resist brute-force attacks

-Avoid using common words, phrases, or predictable patterns such as "123456" or "Password!"

# Most common Password Attacks 

**1. Brute Force Attack**

-Tries every possible character combination until the correct password is found.

-Becomes easier with short or simple passwords.

-Can be slowed or prevented with account lockouts or rate-limiting mechanisms.

**2. Dictionary Attack**

-Uses a list of common words, names, and phrases instead of trying all combinations.

-Exploits users who use simple or common passwords like "qwerty" or "welcome123".

-More efficient than brute-force and often used as a first step by attackers.

**3. Credential Stuffing**

Reuses leaked username/password pairs from past data breaches.

Exploits the habit of password reuse across multiple websites.

Automated tools quickly test credentials on many platforms, often undetected.

# Affect Of Password Complexity on Security

-Increased complexity makes passwords harder to guess or crack, especially by brute-force or dictionary attacks.

-Long and complex passwords exponentially increase the time needed to break them, deterring attackers.

-Complex passwords reduce vulnerability to automated attacks that target weak or commonly used credentials.
